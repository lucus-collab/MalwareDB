## Getting started
I don't recommend run it on real machine, so get an emulators.

* [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com/download.php?main=1) or [DOSEMU](http://www.dosemu.org/stable/) for running DOS viruses
* [PCem](https://pcem-emulator.co.uk/downloads.html) or [86box](http://ci.86box.net/job/86Box/) for running older operating systems on older hardware (this emulators require roms, get them from here [for 86box](https://github.com/BaRRaKudaRain/86box-ROMs) or here [for PCem](https://github.com/BaRRaKudaRain/PCem-ROMs))
* [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/download/) or [BOCHS](http://bochs.sourceforge.net/getcurrent.html) if you want more flexible settings
* If you want modern and easy emulator, use VMware or [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

Install operating system such as Windows or UNIX like or other type of software needed to run the virus.
Now run it and enjoy its payloads.
